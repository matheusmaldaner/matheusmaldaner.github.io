## About

Hi, my name is Matheus Kunzler Maldaner and I am a first-year master's student at the University of Florida in the M.S. AI Systems Program. I was born and raised in Brazil and moved to Florida in 2017 where I attended highschool at Marjory Stoneman Douglas (not the greatest timing I know). I graduated Summa Cum Laude with B.S. in Data Science from the University of Florida with a thesis on the applications of Differentiable Logic Gate Networks. During my senior year at UF, I was also inducted...
