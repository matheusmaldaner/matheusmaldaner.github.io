    "description": "Last Friday marked my last day as a research intern in the AI Frontiers group at Microsoft Research! Since I am not a graduate student (yet), I joined this summer through the Undergraduate Research Internship (URI) program. This works as a subset of the overall research intern program, which let me work closely with other PhD interns and attend the same events.",
    "secondParagraph": "I went into this internship expecting to just spend my days doing research on agentic systems, with maybe a few social opportunities sprinkled in over the summer. But what actually happened was far from that. From competing at Microsoft's yearly Puzzle Day to attending two concerts, sailing a pirate ship, going to a Sounder's soccer game, participating in (and somehow winning) both intern art competitions, and getting not one, but two Xboxes, it is safe to say that this was a summer well lived. Despite how accomplished everyone I met this summer was, one commonality I saw was their level of humility. I lost count of how many times I had the privilege of speaking with world renowned researchers about simple things, or how often they were open to grabbing a coffee despite their busy schedules. I even had the honor of meeting some of the company's leaders including Peter Lee, Doug Burger, Ashley Llorens, and Ece Kamar who, like the rest, were extremely humble and kind. I thank my mentors, Hussein Mozannar, Gagan Bansal and Adam Fourney for the countless meetings, lunches, and for everything I learned. If I were to go back, I would not change a single thing. I am happy to have made amazing friendships and am excited to see what my fellow interns accomplish next.",

We introduce MIRAGE - a web-based tool where users can enter a prompt and quickly generate outputs from multiple text-to-image models, viewing them side-by-side for easy comparison. Last week, I had the opportunity to fly to San Diego to present our work at ACM Collective Intelligence, in collaboration with Wesley Deng, Jason Hong, Ken Holstein, Motahhare Eslami, and the CMU Human-Computer Interaction Institute.",
    "secondParagraph": "In our user study with 15 participants, we found that: seeing multiple models side-by-side helped people spot new details they had missed when looking at a single model. When viewing a single model, participants focused on intra-variance (differences among images from the same model). With multiple models visible, they shifted to inter-variance (differences between models). Bilingual participants (Chinese and Portuguese) uncovered language-fidelity issues, as some models performed much worse when prompts were given in their native language versus English.",

We developed an application to visualize the inner workings of differentiable logic gate networks. Users are able to upload a trained model (.pth file) to load the model's learned logic gates and then input images to visualize how the model propagates the input through the network and ultimately why a given image is classified as such. This enables more transparent and explainable AI and allows users to understand exactly what is going on under the hood. It is still hard to interpret thousands of logic gates and that is an interesting research direction.",
