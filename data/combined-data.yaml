  bio:
    main: >
      Hi, my name is <strong>Matheus Kunzler Maldaner</strong> and I am a first-year master's student at the University
      of Florida in the M.S. AI Systems Program.

      I was born and raised in Brazil and moved to Florida in 2017 where I attended highschool at Marjory Stoneman
      Douglas (not the greatest timing I know).

      I graduated <strong>Summa Cum Laude</strong> with B.S. in Data Science from the University of Florida with a
      thesis on the applications of Differentiable Logic Gate Networks.

      During my senior year at UF, I was also inducted into the <strong>UF Hall of Fame</strong> and awarded the
      <strong>Outstanding Student Leader Award</strong> for my academic and leadership contributions, the two highest
      honors given to students at the University of Florida.

      When I am not studying I enjoy making sushi (having worked at a sushi place for 2y), bouldering (to fit the
      average tech-bro stereotype), running (planning for a half in May), participating in (and sometimes winning)
      hackathons and upkeeping my TH18 Clash of Clans base (my most impressive achievement tbh).
  sections:
    - title: Research Involvement
      content: >
        Besides being a full time student at UF, I conduct research with the <strong>Florida Institute for National
        Security (FINS)</strong> on Neurosymbolic AI working with Dr. Damon Woodard and Dr. Domenic Forte, particularly
        on the application of Differentiable Logic Gate Networks.

        I conduct research remotely at <strong>Carnegie Mellon University's</strong> Human Computer Interaction
        Institute, working with Dr. Jason Hong, Dr. Motahhare Eslami and Dr. Kenneth Holstein, and mentor Wesley Deng on
        the development of tools to audit text-to-image models.

        Within <strong>Microsoft Research's</strong> AI Frontier group, I work primarily with Dr. Hussein Mozannar, Dr.
        Gagan Bansal and Dr. Adam Fourney on enabling Agentic Systems to perform longer running tasks, and currently on
        the development on SentinelBench.
    - title: Student Leadership
      content: >
        Outside of research, I am heavily involved within student organizations at the University of Florida.

        I currently serve a second-term as the <strong>President of the Data Science and Informatics (DSI)</strong>
        Organization, overseeing an executive board of 30 students. We are fortunate to have won the UF Student
        Organization of the Year Award last year among 1000+ UF organizations.

        I am also the <strong>Co-Founder and Vice President for UF's IEEE Signal Processing Society</strong> with my
        good friend Raul Valle, where I am serving a second-term.

        Lastly, I serve as the <strong>Director of Research for UF's AI Club</strong> for the 2025-2026 academic year,
        and was previously in charge of their campus connections iniatives during 2024-2025.
    - title: Previous Leadership
      content: >
        Some previous leadership roles include serving as the <strong>President of Marjory's Garden</strong>
        (2018-2021), <strong>President of National Honor Society</strong> (2020-2021) and <strong>Captain of Mu Alpha
        Theta's Calculus Team</strong> (2020-2021) in my high-school.

        At the University of Florida, I served as the <strong>Workshop Director for DSI</strong> (2023-2024) before my
        first term as President, <strong>Vice President of UF's American Statistical Association</strong> (2023-2024)
        and a <strong>Mentor for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers</strong> (2023-2024).

      AI agents powered by large language models are increasingly capable of autonomously completing complex, multi-step
      tasks using external tools. Yet, they still fall short of human-level performance in most domains including
      computer use, software development, and research. Their growing autonomy and ability to interact with the outside
      world, also introduces safety and security risks including potentially misaligned actions and adversarial
      manipulation. We argue that human-in-the-loop agentic systems offer a promising path forward, combining human
      oversight and control with AI efficiency to unlock productivity from imperfect systems. We introduce Magentic-UI,
      an open-source web interface for developing and studying human-agent interaction. Built on a flexible multi-agent
      architecture, Magentic-UI supports web browsing, code execution, and file manipulation, and can be extended with
      diverse tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP). Moreover, Magentic-UI presents six interaction mechanisms for
      enabling effective, low-cost human involvement: co-planning, co-tasking, multi-tasking, action guards, and
      long-term memory. We evaluate Magentic-UI across four dimensions: autonomous task completion on agentic
      benchmarks, simulated user testing of its interaction capabilities, qualitative studies with real users, and
      targeted safety assessments. Our findings highlight Magentic-UI's potential to advance safe and efficient
      human-agent collaboration.

      While generative AI systems have gained popularity in diverse applications, their potential to produce harmful
      outputs limits their trustworthiness and utility. A small but growing line of research has explored tools and
      processes to better engage non-AI expert users in auditing generative AI systems. In this work, we present the
      design and evaluation of MIRAGE, a web-based tool exploring a 'contrast-first' workflow that allows users to pick
      up to four different text-to-image (T2I) models, view their images side-by-side, and provide feedback on model
      performance on a single screen. In our user study with fifteen participants, we used four predefined models for
      consistency, with only a single model initially being shown. We found that most participants shifted from
      analyzing individual images to general model output patterns once the side-by-side step appeared with all four
      models; several participants coined persistent 'model personalities' (e.g., cartoonish, saturated) that helped
      them form expectations about how each model would behave on future prompts. Bilingual participants also surfaced a
      language-fidelity gap, as English prompts produced more accurate images than Portuguese or Chinese, an issue often
      overlooked when dealing with a single model. These findings suggest that simple comparative interfaces can
      accelerate bias discovery and reshape how people think about generative models.

      Constraining deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn individual logic types per node, as performed using the
      DiffLogic network architecture, opens the door to model-specific explanation techniques that quell the complexity
      inherent to DNNs. Inspired by principles of circuit analysis from computer engineering, this work presents an
      algorithm (eXpLogic) for producing saliency maps which explain input patterns that activate certain functions. The
      eXpLogic explanations: (1) show the exact set of inputs responsible for a decision, which helps interpret false
      negative and false positive predictions, (2) highlight common input patterns that activate certain outputs, and
      (3) help reduce the network size to improve class-specific inference. To evaluate the eXpLogic saliency map, we
      introduce a metric that quantifies how much an input changes before switching a model's class prediction (the
      SwitchDist) and use this metric to compare eXpLogic against the Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradient
      (IG) methods. Generally, we show that eXpLogic saliency maps are better at predicting which inputs will change the
      class score. These maps help reduce the network size and inference times by 87% and 8%, respectively, while having
      a limited impact (-3.8%) on class-specific predictions. The broader value of this work to machine learning is in
      demonstrating how certain DNN architectures promote explainability, which is relevant to healthcare, defense, and
      law.

      While generative AI systems have gained popularity in diverse applications, their potential to produce harmful
      outputs limits their trustworthiness and usability in different applications. Recent years have seen growing
      interest in engaging diverse AI users in auditing generative AI that might impact their lives. To this end, we
      propose MIRAGE as a web-based tool where AI users can compare outputs from multiple AI text-to-image (T2I) models
      by auditing AI-generated images, and report their findings in a structured way. We used MIRAGE to conduct a
      preliminary user study with five participants and found that MIRAGE users could leverage their own lived
      experiences and identities to surface previously unnoticed details around harmful biases when reviewing multiple
      T2I models' outputs compared to reviewing only one.

      Policy makers, healthcare providers, and defense contractors need to understand many types of machine learning
      model behaviors. While eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) provides tools for interpreting these behaviors,
      few frameworks, surveys, and taxonomies produce succinct yet general notation to help researchers and
      practitioners describe their explainability needs and quantify whether these needs are met. Such quantified
      comparisons could help individuals rank XAI methods by their relevance to use-cases, select explanations best
      suited for individual users, and evaluate what explanations are most useful for describing model behaviors. This
      paper collects, decomposes, and abstracts subcomponents of common XAI methods to identify a mathematically
      grounded syntax that applies generally to describing modern and future explanation types while remaining useful
      for discovering novel XAI methods. The resulting syntax, introduced as the Qi-Framework, generally defines
      explanation types in terms of the information being explained, their utility to inspectors, and the methods and
      information used to produce explanations. Just as programming languages define syntax to structure, simplify, and
      standardize software development, so too the Qi-Framework acts as a common language to help researchers and
      practitioners select, compare, and discover XAI methods. Derivative works may extend and implement the
      Qi-Framework to develop a more rigorous science for interpretable machine learning and inspire collaborative
      competition arcoss XAI research.

      Despite their remarkable capabilities, the decision-making process of deep neural networks remains a black box,
      obscuring the logic behind model decisions and undermining trust in critical domains such as healthcare, national
      security, and law. While the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged to mitigate these
      issues, current post hoc explanation methods often fail to deliver reliable insights as they are applied after a
      model has been trained, rather than addressing the underlying architecture. To overcome these fundamental
      limitations, this thesis explores Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DiffLogic), a type of neurosymbolic AI
      (NSAI) architecture that enables neural networks to learn a distribution of logic gates for each node. Although
      DiffLogic was originally introduced with a focus on accelerating inference speeds, its potential for
      explainability has remained largely unexplored. Specifically, this work seeks to address these gaps by: (1)
      implementing DiffLogic on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) for hardware acceleration, (2) developing a
      compression algorithm for DiffLogic models, and (3) deploying visualization tools to intuitively interpret learned
      logical structures.

      My sister Luana Kunzler Maldaner and I placed 3rd overall and won 3 out of 7 tracks (Music, Nature, and Still
      Image) at this year's UF Gator Create competition, part of UF AI Days. Our project "Symbiosis" reimagines
      Gainesville after the noise fades: UF landmarks surrender to quiet ecosystems where roots thread through circuits
      and glass becomes trellis.
    secondParagraph: >-
      Each piece pairs a familiar site (Century Tower, Marston, etc.) with patient, non-catastrophic reclamation - moss
      in the seams, banyan roots over stone, wetlands returning to fields. I built the images with locally hosted,
      open-source diffusion models in ComfyUI, using ControlNet for architectural preservation and inpainting to
      integrate organic growth. The work draws on restoration ecology and solarpunk optimism, suggesting that technology
      does not vanish; it composts into new habitats. Thank you to our friend Brandon Wand for his support - I competed
      with him last year.

      My team and I won first place at UF's Gator Hack, the University of Florida's 2025 AI Days hackathon! Our project
      "Plato's Cave - A Human-Centered Agentic System for Validating Research Papers" is a tool designed to help
      researchers verify claims in academic papers using AI agents that scour the web for evidence.
    secondParagraph: >-
      Inspired by Microsoft's Magentic-UI system, Plato's Cave takes a research paper as input and creates a knowledge
      graph of the paper's main claims. Our web agent then autonomously verifies each claim through web searches,
      computing a confidence score for every assertion. I'm grateful to my teammates Kristian O'Connor, Stephen Wormald,
      Raul Valle, and James Woelke for building this in 48 hours, and to the Florida Institute for National Security
      (FINS), Lesly Galiana, and Dr. Damon L. Woodard for their support.

      Last Friday marked my last day as a research intern in the AI Frontiers group at Microsoft Research! Since I am
      not a graduate student (yet), I joined this summer through the Undergraduate Research Internship (URI) program.
      This works as a subset of the overall research intern program, which let me work closely with other PhD interns
      and attend the same events.
    secondParagraph: >-
      I went into this internship expecting to just spend my days doing research on agentic systems, with maybe a few
      social opportunities sprinkled in over the summer. But what actually happened was far from that. From competing at
      Microsoft's yearly Puzzle Day to attending two concerts, sailing a pirate ship, going to a Sounder's soccer game,
      participating in (and somehow winning) both intern art competitions, and getting not one, but two Xboxes, it is
      safe to say that this was a summer well lived. Despite how accomplished everyone I met this summer was, one
      commonality I saw was their level of humility. I lost count of how many times I had the privilege of speaking with
      world renowned researchers about simple things, or how often they were open to grabbing a coffee despite their
      busy schedules. I even had the honor of meeting some of the company's leaders including Peter Lee, Doug Burger,
      Ashley Llorens, and Ece Kamar who, like the rest, were extremely humble and kind. I thank my mentors, Hussein
      Mozannar, Gagan Bansal and Adam Fourney for the countless meetings, lunches, and for everything I learned. If I
      were to go back, I would not change a single thing. I am happy to have made amazing friendships and am excited to
      see what my fellow interns accomplish next.

      I had the opportunity to fly to San Diego to present our work at ACM Collective Intelligence, in collaboration
      with Wesley Deng, Jason Hong, Ken Holstein, Motahhare Eslami, and the CMU Human-Computer Interaction Institute.
    secondParagraph: >-
      In our user study with 15 participants using MIRAGE, we found that seeing multiple models side-by-side helped
      people spot new details they had missed when looking at a single model. When viewing a single model, participants
      focused on intra-variance (differences among images from the same model). With multiple models visible, they
      shifted to inter-variance (differences between models). Bilingual participants (Chinese and Portuguese) uncovered
      language-fidelity issues, as some models performed much worse when prompts were given in their native language
      versus English. I also had the chance to run into my friend Claire (in last pic) and explore San Diego.

      My team and I won the Best Visualization Award at the 2025 UF ASA DataFest competition. This is the third year the
      event is hosted and also the third year I have competed.
    secondParagraph: >-
      The event is akin to a hackathon but for data science. Over the span of 2 days, teams are given a dataset and are
      tasked with extracting insights from the data and pitching their findings with a 5 slide presentation to a panel
      of judges. Grateful for my friends Aaron, Adit, Ishan and Aadhi (who got sick and did not make the closing
      ceremony)for the company and for the opportunity to compete.

      My friends Kristian O'Connor, Danush Singla, Pranav Bhargava and I won the Best AI Award at UF Swamphacks X, the
      University of Florida's biggest hackathon event. We developed an application to visualize the inner workings of
      differentiable logic gate networks. Users are able to upload a trained model (.pth file) to load the model's
      learned logic gates and then input images to visualize how the model propagates the input through the network and
      ultimately why a given image is classified as such. This enables more transparent and explainable AI and allows
      users to understand exactly what is going on under the hood. It is still hard to interpret thousands of logic
      gates and that is an interesting research direction.

      My friend Brandon Wand and I placed 2nd overall in the University of Florida's Generative AI Arts Competition. The
      report and our generated images are attached in the links below. We sought to represent how social media can warp
      one's perception of reality. We primarily leveraged Flux and LoRA to generate the base imagery and used ESRGAN to
      upscale them to 4K. Brandon then did some minor fine-tuning on photoshop (which I do not know how to properly use)
      to fix some of the artifacts like fingers and faces.

      personalized learning pathways based on a user's existing knowledge.
    secondParagraph: This experience sparked my love for hackathons and set the foundation for the subsequent hackathons I competed in.
