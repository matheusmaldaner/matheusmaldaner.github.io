  description: Grateful to have been awarded the HiPerGator Early Career Award for my work in using high-performance computing to optimize differentiable logic gate networks! HiPerGator is the University of Florida's supercomputer, and one of the nation's most powerful academic clusters with over 500 B200s.
  secondParagraph: Thank you UF Information Technology (UFIT), and Drs. Matt Gitzendanner, Erik Deumens, and Ying Zhang for the recognition of my work. I would like to extend my gratitude to Dr. Cátia Silva, in whose class I first used HiPerGator, to Dr. Damon L. Woodard, with whom I have done the aforementioned work, and to both the UF AI2 Center and UF AIIRI for helping host the ceremony. I am also honored to share this with my good friend Raul Valle, who not only nominated me but also won alongside me at this year's AI Days Hackathon. Congratulations as well to Dr. Andrea Ramirez-Salgado and Dr. Cátia Silva for your awards!

  description: "My sister Luana Kunzler Maldaner and I placed 3rd overall and won 3 out of 7 tracks (Music, Nature, and Still Image) at this year's UF Gator Create competition, part of UF AI Days. Our project \"Symbiosis\" reimagines Gainesville after the noise fades: UF landmarks surrender to quiet ecosystems where roots thread through circuits and glass becomes trellis."
  secondParagraph: Each piece pairs a familiar site (Century Tower, Marston, etc.) with patient, non-catastrophic reclamation - moss in the seams, banyan roots over stone, wetlands returning to fields. I built the images with locally hosted, open-source diffusion models in ComfyUI, using ControlNet for architectural preservation and inpainting to integrate organic growth. The work draws on restoration ecology and solarpunk optimism, suggesting that technology does not vanish; it composts into new habitats. Thank you to our friend Brandon Wand for his support - I competed with him last year.

  description: My team and I won first place at UF's Gator Hack, the University of Florida's 2025 AI Days hackathon! Our project "Plato's Cave – A Human-Centered Agentic System for Validating Research Papers" is a tool designed to help researchers verify claims in academic papers using AI agents that scour the web for evidence.
  secondParagraph: Inspired by Microsoft's Magentic-UI system, Plato's Cave takes a research paper as input and creates a knowledge graph of the paper's main claims. Our web agent then autonomously verifies each claim through web searches, computing a confidence score for every assertion. I'm grateful to my teammates Kristian O'Connor, Stephen Wormald, Raul Valle, and James Woelke for building this in 48 hours, and to the Florida Institute for National Security (FINS), Lesly Galiana, and Dr. Damon L. Woodard for their support.

  description: Last Friday marked my last day as a research intern in the AI Frontiers group at Microsoft Research! Since I am not a graduate student (yet), I joined this summer through the Undergraduate Research Internship (URI) program. This works as a subset of the overall research intern program, which let me work closely with other PhD interns and attend the same events.
  secondParagraph: I went into this internship expecting to just spend my days doing research on agentic systems, with maybe a few social opportunities sprinkled in over the summer. But what actually happened was far from that. From competing at Microsoft's yearly Puzzle Day to attending two concerts, sailing a pirate ship, going to a Sounder's soccer game, participating in (and somehow winning) both intern art competitions, and getting not one, but two Xboxes, it is safe to say that this was a summer well lived. Despite how accomplished everyone I met this summer was, one commonality I saw was their level of humility. I lost count of how many times I had the privilege of speaking with world renowned researchers about simple things, or how often they were open to grabbing a coffee despite their busy schedules. I even had the honor of meeting some of the company's leaders including Peter Lee, Doug Burger, Ashley Llorens, and Ece Kamar who, like the rest, were extremely humble and kind. I thank my mentors, Hussein Mozannar, Gagan Bansal and Adam Fourney for the countless meetings, lunches, and for everything I learned. If I were to go back, I would not change a single thing. I am happy to have made amazing friendships and am excited to see what my fellow interns accomplish next.

  description: A little bit of a late post but I want to express my gratitude for the summer I spent at Carnegie Mellon University. With the mentorship of professors Jason Hong, Motahhare Eslami, and Ken Holstein and PhD student Wesley Deng, we developed Mirage, a web-based application to explore whether viewing outputs from multiple text-to-image AI models side by side can help users spot details they might miss when examining a single model.
  secondParagraph: I am happy that we have submitted a demo paper to HCOMP and that I can continue working remotely with CMU this semester. I extend my gratitude to Laura Dabbish and Julia Chadwick for organizing this program, to all professors that hosted weekly seminars and to all the amazing people I met!

  description: Incredibly honored to have attended this year's Heidelberg Laureate Forum in Germany with some extremely bright minds! This is a yearly event which brings 200 young researchers from around the world to spend a week with the recipients of the most prestigious prizes in mathematics and computer sciences, such as the Turing Award, Fields Medal, Abel Prize, and Nevanlinna Prize.
  secondParagraph: It was a pleasure to speak with many laureates whom I've grown up hearing and reading about. I would like to thank Leslie Valiant, Vint Cerf, David Silver, Jeff Dean, Richard Sutton, Pat Hanrahan, Jack Dongarra, Robert Tarjan, Jeffrey Ullman, Torsten Hoefler, and Bob Metcalfe, to name a few, for the great conversations and advice you've given me. Thank you Sarah MacLeod, Martina Wagner-Opitz, and all the organizing team, for this opportunity, as well as Demian Nahuel Goos Bosco and Clara Kümpel for setting up the art exposition and the continuous support in the months leading up to the forum. I also extend my gratitude to Drs. Joe Glover, Cátia Silva, and Damon L. Woodard for their support with travel logistics, as well as Drs. Ken Holstein and Jason Hong for their help with the application process. Happy to have made new friends, learned a lot, and explored a new city. I look forward to crossing paths with you all in the future!

  description: I had the opportunity to fly to San Diego to present our work at ACM Collective Intelligence, in collaboration with Wesley Deng, Jason Hong, Ken Holstein, Motahhare Eslami, and the CMU Human-Computer Interaction Institute.
  secondParagraph: "In our user study with 15 participants using MIRAGE, we found that seeing multiple models side-by-side helped people spot new details they had missed when looking at a single model. When viewing a single model, participants focused on intra-variance (differences among images from the same model). With multiple models visible, they shifted to inter-variance (differences between models). Bilingual participants (Chinese and Portuguese) uncovered language-fidelity issues, as some models performed much worse when prompts were given in their native language versus English. I also had the chance to run into my friend Claire (in last pic) and explore San Diego."

  description: My friends Kristian O'Connor, Danush Singla, Pranav Bhargava and I won the Best AI Award at UF Swamphacks X, the University of Florida's biggest hackathon event. We developed an application to visualize the inner workings of differentiable logic gate networks. Users are able to upload a trained model (.pth file) to load the model's learned logic gates and then input images to visualize how the model propagates the input through the network and ultimately why a given image is classified as such. This enables more transparent and explainable AI and allows users to understand exactly what is going on under the hood. It is still hard to interpret thousands of logic gates and that is an interesting research direction.

We sought to represent how social media can warp one's perception of reality. We primarily leveraged Flux and LoRA to generate the base imagery and used ESRGAN to upscale them to 4K. Brandon then did some minor fine-tuning on photoshop (which I do not know how to properly use) to fix some of the artifacts like fingers and faces. "
