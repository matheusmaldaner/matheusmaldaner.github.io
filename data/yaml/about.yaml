# About Me Page Content
bio:
  main: |
    Hi, my name is Matheus Kunzler Maldaner and I am a first-year master's student at the University of Florida in the M.S. AI Systems Program.
    I was born and raised in Brazil and moved to Florida in 2017 where I attended highschool at Marjory Stoneman Douglas (not the greatest timing I know).
    I graduated Summa Cum Laude with B.S. in Data Science from the University of Florida with a thesis on the applications of Differentiable Logic Gate Networks.
    During my senior year at UF, I was also inducted into the UF Hall of Fame and awarded the Outstanding Student Leader Award for my academic and leadership contributions, the two highest honors given to students at the University of Florida.
    When I am not studying I enjoy making sushi (having worked at a sushi place for 2y), bouldering (to fit the average tech-bro stereotype), running (planning for a half in May), participating in (and sometimes winning) hackathons and upkeeping my TH18 Clash of Clans base (my most impressive achievement tbh).

      Besides being a full time student at UF, I conduct research with the Florida Institute for National Security (FINS) on Neurosymbolic AI working with Dr. Damon Woodard and Dr. Domenic Forte, particularly on the application of Differentiable Logic Gate Networks.
      I conduct research remotely at Carnegie Mellon University's Human Computer Interaction Institute, working with Dr. Jason Hong, Dr. Motahhare Eslami and Dr. Kenneth Holstein, and mentor Wesley Deng on the development of tools to audit text-to-image models.
      Within the Microsoft Research's AI Frontier group, I work primarily with Dr. Hussein Mozannar, Dr. Gagan Bansal and Dr. Adam Fourney on enabling Agentic Systems to perform longer running tasks, and currently on the development on SentinelBench.

      Outside of research, I am heavily involved within student organizations at the University of Florida.
      I currently serve a second-term as the President of the Data Science and Informatics (DSI) Organization, overseeing an executive board of 30 students. We are fortunate to have won the UF Student Organization of the Year Award last year among 1000+ UF organizations.
      I also Co-Founded UF's IEEE Signal Processing Society with my good friend Raul Valle, where I am serving a second-term as Vice-President.
      Lastly, I serve as the Director of Research for UF's AI Club for the 2025-2026 academic year, and was previously in charge of their campus connections iniatives during 2024-2025.

      Some previous leadership roles include serving as the President of Marjory's Garden (2018-2021), President of National Honor Society (2020-2021) and Captain of Mu Alpha Theta's Calculus Team (2020-2021) in my high-school.
      At the University of Florida, I served as the Workshop Director for DSI (2023-2024) before my first term as President, Vice President of UF's American Statistical Association (2023-2024) and a mentor for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (2023-2024).
