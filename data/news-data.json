Mirage is a web-based application we developed to explore the hypothesis that viewing outputs from multiple text-to-image AI models side-by-side can help users spot details they might otherwise miss when examining a single model.",
    "secondParagraph": "As my first conference, HCOMP definitely set the bar high. I had an amazing time learning from professionals, presenting our research, and connecting with new people! Special thanks to everyone at Carnegie Mellon University for the continued support, the National Science Foundation (NSF) for awarding me a Travel Grant, and the HCOMP organizers.",

We developed an application to visualize the inner workings of differentiable logic gate networks. Users are able to upload a trained model (.pth file) to load the model's learned logic gates and then input images to visualize how the model propagates the input through the network and ultimately why a given image is classified as such. This enables more transparent and explainable AI and allows users to understand exactly what is going on under the hood. It is still hard to interpret thousands of logic gates and that is an interesting research direction.",
