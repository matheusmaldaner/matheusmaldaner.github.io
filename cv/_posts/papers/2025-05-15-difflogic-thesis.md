This undergraduate thesis advances neurosymbolic AI by operationalizing Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DiffLogic) across hardware, compression, and visualization pipelines. The work deploys DiffLogic on FPGAs for efficient inference, proposes a compression strategy that preserves decision fidelity, and delivers interpretability tooling that exposes the logical structures learned by the network. Due to an embargo, the manuscript will be released at a later date.
