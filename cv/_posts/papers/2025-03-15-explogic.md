eXpLogic provides saliency explanations for DiffLogic networks by modeling how learned logic gates interact. Drawing on circuit analysis, the method traces which input patterns most influence node activations and downstream predictions. Evaluations against gradient-based explanations show that eXpLogic better anticipates score changes and enables aggressive model compression—reducing parameters by 87% and improving inference latency with minimal accuracy impact.
