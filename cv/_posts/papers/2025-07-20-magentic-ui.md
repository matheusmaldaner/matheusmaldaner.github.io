Magentic-UI is an open-source interface and architecture for studying collaborative workflows between humans and AI agents. The system supports co-planning, action approval, real-time oversight, and memory sharing across long-running web tasks. We argue that human-in-the-loop designs remain essential for deploying powerful agentic systems safely, and we showcase how Magentic-UI enables nuanced oversight and intervention across complex, multi-step scenarios.
