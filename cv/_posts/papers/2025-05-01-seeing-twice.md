We study auditing workflows for text-to-image systems through MIRAGE, a contrast-first interface that reveals up to four models simultaneously. In a user study with fifteen participants we observed strategies shift from single-image critiques to pattern-based reasoning once side-by-side comparison became available. Participants leveraged the multi-model view to triangulate problematic behaviors and articulate richer hypotheses about model failures.
