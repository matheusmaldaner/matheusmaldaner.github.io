This work introduces the Qi-Framework, a mathematically grounded syntax for describing explainability requirements across machine learning systems. By decomposing common eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques into modular sub-components, the framework standardizes how practitioners reason about their explanation needs, compare methods, and identify gaps in available tooling. The framework supports ranking XAI approaches by utility for a target use case and encourages collaborative development of interpretable AI techniques.
