									<p>
										Currently, I am immersing myself in the intricate realms of machine learning, cybersecurity, and advanced 
										computational concepts like predicate calculus and propositional logic. These areas are not just academic 
										interests but passions that shape my view of technology's future. As a Researcher at the Florida Institute of National Security, 
										I explore the frontiers of NeuroSymbolic AI, constantly challenging myself with new perspectives. 
										In my role as Vice President of the American Statistical Association, I focus on building community, fostering learning, 
										and developing leadership skills. My goal is to continuously expand my knowledge and skills, preparing myself for a future 
										where I can contribute significantly to the field of AI.
