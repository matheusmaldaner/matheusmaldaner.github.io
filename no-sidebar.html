									<h3>About Myself</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Hi, my name is Matheus Kunzler Maldaner and I am currently a Data Science undergraduate at the University of Florida with a minor in Computer Science. 
									I originally moved from Brazil in 2017 for the pursuit of a better education and safety, though the irony lies that I ended up attending Marjory Stoneman Douglas highschool. 
									Moving on to my college life, I applied to the University of Florida under the impression I would like to pursue a degree in Astrophysics, though my heart quickly
									drifted towards UF's Data Science program, which was new at the time and is a combination of several Computer Science and Statistics courses. Driven by a fascination with technology 
									(and a small grudge on data cleaning) I found my passion in the realm of Machine Learning and seek to gain experience through summer internships or research opportunities in this area.

										<h3>My Current Goals</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Besides taking classes with the intent of framing my glorified <del>piece of paper</del> diploma, I am currently learning about predicate calculus and propositional logic. 
										Though I do unironically like mathematics, understanding these concepts are crucial for my current work as a Researcher at the Florida Institute of National Security, 
										where I explore the new advancements of NeuroSymbolic AI, which is essentially a combination of neural networks with symbolic reasoning.
										Outside the classroom, I currently serve as Vice President of the American Statistical Association, Workshop Director for the Data Science and Informatics Institute and
										an mentor for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. At the moment I seek to keep gaining experience through research and possibly internships this upcoming summer,
										in a way that can propel me forward in this fast paced industry.

										<h3>What's Next</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Looking ahead, I seek to pursue a PhD where I can dive deeper into AI research and contribute to groundbreaking discoveries, especially in the development of new and 
										more optimized machine learning models. My vision is to be at the forefront of AI innovation, be able to attend conferences, spreading knowledge and most important, meet likeminded
										people in this field. I dream of helping create a future that reflects my values and aspirations - one where technology and humanity converge to unlock new possibilities. 
										At the end of my life, I seek to have paved a path for the pioneers of tomorrow, leaving a meaningful and positive impact that my parents could have been proud of.
